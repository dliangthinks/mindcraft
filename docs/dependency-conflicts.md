# Dependency Version Conflicts

This document identifies and analyzes version conflicts between dependencies in the headless package and web app as part of Task 1.11 in the package merge process.

## Version Conflicts Summary

| Dependency | Headless Version | Web App Version | Recommended Version | Reasoning |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| @radix-ui/react-slot | ^1.1.1 | ^1.0.2 | ^1.1.1 | Use newer version with potential bug fixes and improvements |
| @types/node | ^22.10.6 | ^20.11.24 | ^22.10.6 | Use newer version for latest Node.js typings |
| @types/react | ^18.2.55 | ^18.2.61 | ^18.2.61 | Use newer version for latest React typings |
| @types/react-dom | 18.2.19 (exact) | ^18.2.19 (with caret) | ^18.2.19 | Use caret version to allow minor updates |
| react-markdown | ^9.0.3 | ^9.0.1 | ^9.0.3 | Use newer version with potential bug fixes |
| typescript | ^5.7.3 | ^5.4.2 | ^5.7.3 | Use newer version with the latest TypeScript features |

## Detailed Analysis of Each Conflict

### 1. @radix-ui/react-slot

**Headless Version:** ^1.1.1  
**Web App Version:** ^1.0.2  
**Severity:** Low  

**Analysis:**
- Both versions should be compatible as they use the same major version (1.x.x)
- Version 1.1.1 likely includes bug fixes and minor improvements over 1.0.2
- The Slot component is used in the editor bubble items

**Recommendation:**
- Use version ^1.1.1 in the merged codebase
- Test to ensure this doesn't cause any regressions in components using Slot

### 2. @types/node

**Headless Version:** ^22.10.6  
**Web App Version:** ^20.11.24  
**Severity:** Low  

**Analysis:**
- These are TypeScript type definitions for Node.js
- The headless package is using a much newer version (22.x vs 20.x)
- Type definitions don't affect runtime behavior
- Newer versions typically include more accurate typings for newer Node.js APIs

**Recommendation:**
- Use version ^22.10.6 in the merged codebase
- Verify that this doesn't cause any TypeScript errors in the web app

### 3. @types/react

**Headless Version:** ^18.2.55  
**Web App Version:** ^18.2.61  
**Severity:** Low  

**Analysis:**
- These are TypeScript type definitions for React
- The web app is using a slightly newer version
- Both are compatible with React 18.2.x

**Recommendation:**
- Use version ^18.2.61 in the merged codebase
- This represents the latest React typings and should be compatible with all code

### 4. @types/react-dom

**Headless Version:** 18.2.19 (exact)  
**Web App Version:** ^18.2.19 (with caret)  
**Severity:** Very Low  

**Analysis:**
- These versions are identical except for the version specifier (exact vs. caret)
- The headless package locks to exactly 18.2.19
- The web app allows minor and patch updates (^18.2.19)

**Recommendation:**
- Use version ^18.2.19 in the merged codebase
- This allows for patch updates while maintaining compatibility

### 5. react-markdown

**Headless Version:** ^9.0.3  
**Web App Version:** ^9.0.1  
**Severity:** Low  

**Analysis:**
- Both versions are from the same major version (9.x)
- The headless package uses a slightly newer version
- Differences are likely minimal and mostly bug fixes

**Recommendation:**
- Use version ^9.0.3 in the merged codebase
- Test markdown rendering to ensure compatibility

### 6. typescript

**Headless Version:** ^5.7.3  
**Web App Version:** ^5.4.2  
**Severity:** Medium  

**Analysis:**
- Both are TypeScript 5.x, but with different minor versions
- Version 5.7.3 includes new features and improvements over 5.4.2
- This is a development dependency used for type checking and compilation
- Headless package may use newer TypeScript features not available in 5.4.2

**Recommendation:**
- Use version ^5.7.3 in the merged codebase
- Test the build process thoroughly
- Review code for any usage of TypeScript 5.7 features

## Dependency Resolution Strategy

When merging the packages, follow these guidelines for resolving dependency conflicts:

### 1. General Rules

- **Use the newer version** when versions are close and compatible (same major version)
- **Prefer non-breaking updates** to minimize migration effort
- **Test thoroughly** after updating any dependency

### 2. Implementation Steps

1. Update the web app's package.json with the recommended versions
2. Run `pnpm install` to update dependencies
3. Run type checking (`pnpm typecheck`) to identify any type errors
4. Fix any issues that arise from version updates
5. Test the application thoroughly, especially components using the conflicting dependencies

### 3. Fallback Strategy

If a newer version causes unexpected issues:

1. Roll back to the version used by the web app
2. Identify and fix compatibility issues in the editor code
3. Consider creating adapter layers if necessary

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

### 1. TypeScript Version Update (5.4.2 → 5.7.3)

**Risk:** New TypeScript version may have stricter type checking that reveals existing issues
**Mitigation:** 
- Run type checking early in the migration process
- Address type errors incrementally
- Consider using `// @ts-ignore` or `// @ts-expect-error` temporarily for hard-to-fix issues

### 2. React Types Update

**Risk:** Newer React typings might be incompatible with certain component patterns
**Mitigation:**
- Test components extensively
- Update component typings as needed
- Focus on any components with complex generic types or ref forwarding

### 3. Radix UI Slot Update (1.0.2 → 1.1.1)

**Risk:** Changes in the Slot component behavior might affect editor bubble items
**Mitigation:**
- Test editor bubble menu functionality thoroughly
- Review Radix UI changelog for any breaking changes
- Verify component composition patterns still work as expected

## Conclusion

The dependency conflicts between the packages are relatively minor and can be resolved by using the newer versions in most cases. The most significant update is TypeScript (5.4.2 → 5.7.3), which should be handled carefully to ensure compatibility with the existing codebase.

After resolving these conflicts, the merged codebase will have a more consistent and up-to-date dependency set, which will be easier to maintain in the future.

**Next Steps:** Continue with Task 1.12 to create a list of development dependencies that can be consolidated.
