# Package Structure Analysis: Current Separation and Merge Strategy

## Current Architecture

The Mindcraft project is currently structured as a monorepo using Turborepo and pnpm workspaces. The package separation is as follows:

### Package Structure

1. **packages/headless (mindcraft-editor)**
   - The core editor component built on TipTap
   - Published as `mindcraft-editor` package
   - Contains extensions, editor functionality, and UI components
   - Has its own package.json, build process, and dependencies

2. **packages/tsconfig**
   - Shared TypeScript configurations
   - Used by both the headless package and web application
   - Contains base configs for different environments (base, next, react)

3. **apps/web (mindcraft-web)**
   - Next.js application implementing the editor
   - Imports the headless package as a workspace dependency
   - Contains app-specific components, pages, and business logic

## Pros of Current Separation

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - The editor core (mindcraft-editor) is isolated from the application logic
   - Makes it possible to publish the editor as a standalone package
   - Allows for cleaner dependency management for the core editor

2. **Reusability**
   - The headless editor could be reused in other projects or applications
   - Shared tsconfig ensures consistent TypeScript settings across packages

3. **Independent Versioning**
   - Each package can be versioned separately based on its own release cycle
   - Changes to the editor core can be tracked separately from application changes

4. **Focused Testing and Development**
   - Development can happen independently for each package
   - Testing can be more focused on specific functionality

5. **Easier Contribution Management**
   - Different teams could work on different packages with minimal conflicts
   - Clearer boundaries for contributions and code ownership

## Cons of Current Separation

1. **Development Overhead**
   - Changes to the editor require rebuilding the package before they appear in the web app
   - More complex development workflow with multiple package.json files to maintain
   - Duplication of development dependencies and configurations

2. **Dependency Management Complexity**
   - Managing dependencies across packages can be challenging
   - Risk of dependency version conflicts between packages
   - More complex update process for shared dependencies

3. **Build and Type Checking Complexity**
   - Need for careful ordering of build steps in Turborepo
   - Type checking may fail if packages aren't built in the correct order
   - Increased CI/CD complexity

4. **Additional Boilerplate**
   - Extra configuration files and build tooling for each package
   - Duplicate linting and formatting configurations

5. **Limited Integration Between Components**
   - Components in the headless package can't easily access app-specific features
   - May lead to prop drilling or complex state management to bridge the packages

## Implementation Workflow

For each task in the list:

1. **Planning**: Understand what needs to be accomplished and any dependencies
2. **Implementation**: Complete the task according to the plan
3. **Verification**: Test the changes to ensure they work as expected
4. **Review**: Have another team member review the changes if possible
5. **Check off**: Mark the task as complete
6. **Permission**: Get approval before moving to the next task

## Conclusion

This granular task list provides a structured approach to merging the separated packages into a unified codebase. By breaking down the process into manageable tasks, the team can work methodically through the migration while minimizing disruption to the development workflow.

Each task should be checked off as it's completed, and permission should be obtained before moving on to the next task. This approach allows for careful tracking of progress and ensures that any issues can be addressed before they impact other parts of the migration.

The end result will be a more integrated, maintainable codebase that retains the benefits of clear component boundaries while eliminating the overhead of separate packages.
